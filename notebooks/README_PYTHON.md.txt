# Python Analysis Module – Retail Marketing Analytics

## 1. Purpose
Python was used as the primary tool for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering.  
This module prepares the data for downstream SQL analysis and dashboard visualization.

## 2. Key Activities Performed
The following tasks were completed using Python:
1. Data loading and initial validation
2. Handling missing values and duplicate records
3. Exploratory Data Analysis to understand trends and distributions
4. Feature engineering for customer and product-level insights
5. Exporting cleaned and processed datasets

---

## 3. Notebook Overview
The Python workflow is organized into the following notebooks:
1. `01_data_acquisition.ipynb` – Data loading and validation
2. `02_data_cleaning.ipynb` – Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. `03_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` – EDA and visual analysis
4. `04_feature_engineering.ipynb` – Creation of derived features
5. `06_sqlite_sql_analysis.ipynb` – SQLite integration using Python

## 4. Libraries Used
The primary Python libraries used include:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. sqlite3

---

## 5. Outputs
The Python analysis produces:
1. Cleaned datasets stored in `data/processed/`
2. Feature-enriched datasets for SQL analysis
3. Visual outputs saved in the `outputs/` directory
